## WAT
Needed a place to save my work from [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com). I worked up to chapter 4 without using a vcs but I wanted to get more used to learning git sooooooo here I am.

## Y NO UPDATE THO
Turns out everything on AtBSwP can be knocked out in 20 min and doesn't really benefit from version control. I'm keeping this up as a sort of timestamp for remembering when I started trying to automate more.
