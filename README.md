## WAT
Needed a place to save my work from [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com).
This is an old repo from when I initially worked through the content. I wasn't great about doing using git at the time and never really updated this repo.
## WHY UPDATE
I'm working through the content again to refresh myself with basic Python so I figured it was as good a time as any to use the existing repo.
